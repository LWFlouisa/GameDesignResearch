## To clarify I would be studying OpenCog myself but not necessarily directly implementing, but using some of the ideas.

If you plan to study OpenCog and use some of the ideas within your Tactical Visual Novel project, you can start by exploring the resources provided in [Source 10](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/AI_Documentation). This wiki page offers pointers to various documentation and resources related to OpenCog's AI code, including the CogPrime AGI design, clustering, robotics, and the rule engine.

To get a concise overview of the CogPrime vision, you can read the [CogPrime Overview article](https://www.opencog.org/wiki/CogPrime_Overview). This article will give you a better understanding of how various AI structures and processes are intended to fit together into an overarching whole.

As you explore OpenCog's ideas, you can also refer to the [OpenCog Glossary](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/blob/master/README.md) to understand the lingo used to discuss various aspects of OpenCog and related AI issues.

While studying OpenCog, you can implement its concepts within your Ren'Py game by using Python, as mentioned in my previous responses. By combining OpenCog's ideas with Ren'Py's Python support, you can create a more complex and engaging Tactical Visual Novel that incorporates advanced AI concepts.

Keep in mind that OpenCog's codebase is no longer maintained, so you may need to adapt the ideas to fit within the limitations of Ren'Py and Python. By doing so, you can create a unique and innovative Tactical Visual Novel that leverages the power of OpenCog's AI concepts.
