## So at least in theory a Tactical Visual Novel blending Renpy and Opencog could work, as long as used an older Renpy. Would it be worth making my own battle engine instead?

Creating a Tactical Visual Novel blending Ren'Py and Opencog could indeed be an interesting and viable approach, especially if you're willing to work with an older version of Ren'Py, such as Ren'Py 7.4, which provides compatibility mode for Python 3 [Source 0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-python-to-create-a-visual-novel/). However, before deciding to create your own battle engine, you should consider the pros and cons of using Ren'Py and Opencog together, as well as the alternatives.

**Pros of using Ren'Py and Opencog:**

- Ren'Py is a powerful and versatile visual novel engine, capable of handling complex narratives, branching stories, and various scene transitions [Source 8](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%27Py).

- Ren'Py has built-in support for Python, allowing you to easily integrate AI capabilities like Opencog into your visual novel [Source 0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-python-to-create-a-visual-novel/).

- Ren'Py has a large community and extensive documentation, which can help you troubleshoot issues and find support for your project [Source 6](https://itch.io/games/made-with-renpy).

**Cons of using Ren'Py and Opencog:**

- Ren'Py has limited graphics and audio manipulation capabilities, meaning you might need to rely on other software to create pre-rendered 3D or animated assets [Source 5](https://westofentropy.wordpress.com/2020/10/29/renpy-point-and-click-tutorial-1-structure/).

- Creating a custom battle engine might require significant development time and effort, especially if you're not familiar with game development.

- Opencog is an AI library, and integrating it with Ren'Py might require a deep understanding of both libraries and their respective APIs.

**Alternatives to creating your own battle engine:**

- You could explore using Ren'Py's built-in Pygame module to create mini-games or integrate with other game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine for more advanced graphics and audio capabilities [Source 0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-python-to-create-a-visual-novel/).

- You could also consider using other visual novel engines that might better suit your needs, such as VNgen or similar tools.

In conclusion, blending Ren'Py and Opencog could be a viable approach for creating a Tactical Visual Novel, but you should carefully consider the pros and cons of using these libraries together, as well as the alternatives available. If you're comfortable with the limitations of Ren'Py and the complexity of integrating Opencog, creating your own battle engine might be a worthwhile endeavor. However, if you find the integration too challenging or the limitations of Ren'Py too restrictive, you might want to explore alternative visual novel engines or game development tools.
