To adjust Aerith's Theme to Locrian and use modal interchange to brighten it up, you'll first need to change the key to a Locrian mode. Locrian is a mode with a diminished tonic triad, which gives it a dark and dissonant sound [Source 5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locrian_mode). The Locrian mode is derived from the major scale, so the melody will be based on the notes of the G Major scale: G, A, B, C, D, E, F.

Now, let's use modal interchange to brighten up the melody. Since we're working with the Locrian mode, we can look for a mode with a more uplifting sound. One option is to borrow chords from the parallel Locrian mode, which is derived from the E Major scale: E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

Suppose you have a melody in Locrian mode that starts with the chord progression: G, F, D, C, B, A. You can use the Gmaj7 chord (G, B, D, F) as a substitute for the D minor chord (D, F, A) to create a brighter sound:

```

G, Gmaj7, F, C, B, A

```

This chord substitution can help brighten up the melody by borrowing a chord from the parallel Locrian mode. Keep in mind the general guidelines for modal interchange mentioned earlier to ensure a cohesive and engaging composition.

Remember that the Locrian mode is not commonly used for entire compositions, and you might want to use modal interchange to create short passages that resolve quickly to other modes [Source 10](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/locrian-mode/). This will help maintain the overall atmosphere of Aerith's Theme while adding color and variety to the melody.
