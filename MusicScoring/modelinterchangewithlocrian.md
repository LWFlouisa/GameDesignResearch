## Limited Transposition
Based on the context provided, you're working with a Messaen scale that is slightly modified for limited transposition, resulting in the notes: Bb, B, D, E, F#, G#, and Bb. This scale still maintains a dreamy, floaty, and dissonant quality, but with some resolution.

To brighten up the melody using modal interchange, you can borrow chords from a parallel mode that provides a brighter sound. One option is to use the Locrian mode with a raised second, which is derived from the G Major scale: G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

Suppose you have a melody in your modified Messaen scale that starts with the chord progression: Bb, B, D, E, F#, G#, Bb. You can use the Bbmaj7 chord (Bb, C, D, F) as a substitute for the B minor chord (B, D, F) to create a brighter sound:

```
Bb, B, Bbmaj7, E, F#, G#, Bb
```

This chord substitution can help brighten up the melody by borrowing a chord from the parallel Locrian mode with a raised second. Keep in mind the general guidelines for modal interchange mentioned earlier to ensure a cohesive and engaging composition.

Remember that the key to using modal interchange effectively is to maintain the overall atmosphere of your composition while adding color and variety to the melody. In this case, you want to keep the dreamy and dissonant quality of your modified Messaen scale while adding some resolution and brightness. Experiment with different chord substitutions and borrowed chords from parallel modes to achieve the desired result. 


## Model Interchange
Based on the context provided, you're looking for a parallel mode to Bb Phrygian that acts like a brighter Dorian mode. Since Bb Phrygian is already a mode of a major scale (Gb Major), you can look for a mode derived from the same major scale but with a different starting note. In this case, you can use the 2nd mode of the Gb Major scale, which is A Phrygian.

A Phrygian mode has the same notes as Bb Phrygian, but starting from the A note. The notes in A Phrygian are: A, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G [Source 6](https://onlineguitarbooks.com/b-flat-phrygian-mode/). This mode is not as bright as the Dorian mode, but it is brighter than the original Bb Phrygian mode due to the presence of the major seventh interval (G) in the scale [Source 2](https://themusicambition.com/phrygian-mode/).

To brighten up your melody using A Phrygian mode, you can incorporate chords from the parallel A Lydian mode, which is derived from the Gb Major scale. The A Lydian mode has the following notes: A, B, C#, D#, E, F#, G# [Source 1](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/which-mode-is-brighter.2448430/).

Suppose you have a melody in A Phrygian mode that starts with the chord progression: A, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G. You can use the Amaj7 chord (A, C#, E, G#) as a substitute for the C minor chord (C, Eb, G) to create a brighter sound:

```

A, Bb, A, G, Eb, F, G

```

This chord substitution can help brighten up the melody by borrowing a chord from the parallel A Lydian mode. Keep in mind the general guidelines for modal interchange mentioned earlier to ensure a cohesive and engaging composition.
