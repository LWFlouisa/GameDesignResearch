The music in the Shadow Hearts series feels differently from games like Final Fantasy VII due to several reasons:

1. **Composers and musical styles:** Shadow Hearts features a team of experienced composers, including Yoshitaka Hirota, Masaharu Iwata, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Ryo Fukuda [Source 7](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_the_Shadow_Hearts_series). Their combined expertise and diverse musical styles contribute to the unique atmosphere of the series. In contrast, Final Fantasy VII was composed primarily by Nobuo Uematsu, known for his distinctive style that became synonymous with the Final Fantasy series [Source 1](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-hearts-review/1900-2833884/).

2. **Darker and more complex themes:** Shadow Hearts is known for its dark and gothic atmosphere, with a narrative that delves into serious subject matter and horror elements [Source 5](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Hearts). The music in the series is designed to complement this darker setting, creating a more intense and immersive experience. Final Fantasy VII, while still having a darker tone than some other entries in the series, does not delve as deeply into horror and complex themes.

3. **Balance between darkness and levity:** Shadow Hearts successfully balances its dark themes with moments of levity, creating an emotional narrative that keeps the player engaged [Source 9](https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/12/14/remembering-shadow-hearts.aspx). This balance is not as evident in Final Fantasy VII, which tends to lean more towards a serious and somber atmosphere.

4. **In-game music and vocalization:** Shadow Hearts features vocals during certain cutscenes and full-motion videos, while most of the game consists of written dialogue accompanied by emoticons to display emotions or reactions [Source 5](https://shadowhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Hearts). This unique approach to in-game music and vocalization contributes to the distinctive feel of the series.

Overall, the music in the Shadow Hearts series feels different from Final Fantasy VII due to the combination of composers, musical styles, darker themes, and unique approaches to in-game music and vocalization. These factors create a unique atmosphere that sets the series apart from other JRPGs, including the Final Fantasy series.
