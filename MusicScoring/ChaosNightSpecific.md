This can help create a more engaging and immersive gameplay experience.

This can help maintain the players' interest throughout the game.

5. **Collaborate with your team:** If you're working with a team, collaborate closely with the leads and sound designers to ensure that the music and sound effects complement each other and create a cohesive experience [Source 6](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/getting-making-game-music-that-fits---comparative-music-series---atmospheric-vs-ambient).
