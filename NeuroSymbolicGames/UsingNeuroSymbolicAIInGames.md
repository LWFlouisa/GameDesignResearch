## Using Neuro Symbolic In Games

### One approach I thought of is instead of training the neural net directly, build the game engine and neurosymbolic program seperately, and then use the neuro symbolic process as "smart walkthrough" that guides you through the game.

Neuro-symbolic AI is an approach that integrates neural and symbolic AI architectures to address the strengths and weaknesses of each, resulting in a robust AI system capable of reasoning, learning, and cognitive modeling [Source 1]. It combines the statistical learning capabilities of neural networks with the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of symbolic AI [Source 3]. By fusing these two approaches, neuro-symbolic AI aims to create a new class of AI that is more powerful than the sum of its parts [Source 2].

One approach you mentioned is to build the game engine and neuro-symbolic program separately and then use the neuro-symbolic process as a "smart walkthrough" that guides you through the game. This approach involves using a neuro-symbolic agent to make decisions based on domain knowledge, commonsense knowledge, and reasoning [Source 0]. The policy of the agent is represented as Logical Neural Networks (LNN), which enables explainable decision making and co-learning with human guidance [Source 0]. The neuro-symbolic agent can reduce the number of interactions with the environment for learning the policy, and each stage of the pipeline can be individually verified and examined [Source 0].

Here are some pros and cons of this approach:

Pros:
- Explainability: The neuro-symbolic agent allows for explainable decision making, which is important for understanding and debugging the system.
- Human guidance: The agent can be co-trained with human guidance, allowing for the incorporation of domain knowledge and improving the performance of the system.
- Reduction in interactions: By using domain knowledge and reasoning, the neuro-symbolic agent can reduce the number of interactions with the environment required for learning.

Cons:
- Complexity: Building a separate game engine and neuro-symbolic program can be complex and time-consuming.
- Knowledge acquisition: Acquiring and representing the necessary domain and commonsense knowledge can be challenging.
- Scalability: The neuro-symbolic approach may face scalability issues when applied to large-scale and complex games.

It's important to note that neuro-symbolic AI is an active area of research, and there are many open research questions and ongoing developments [Source 2]. The best way to integrate neural and symbolic architectures, how to represent symbolic structures within neural networks, and how to learn and reason about common-sense knowledge are some of the key research questions [Source 2].

In summary, the approach you mentioned of building the game engine and neuro-symbolic program separately and using the neuro-symbolic process as a "smart walkthrough" is a valid approach in the context of neuro-symbolic AI. It allows for explainable decision making, human guidance, and reduction in interactions with the environment. However, it also comes with challenges such as complexity, knowledge acquisition, and scalability.

### One way could be making the gameplay simpler. My use case is more like a graphical text adventure than a ascii roguelike.

If your use case is more like a graphical text adventure than an ASCII roguelike, there are several ways you can simplify the gameplay and create an immersive experience. Here are some suggestions:

1. Choose a suitable game engine: There are various game engines available that can help you create graphical text adventure games. These engines provide tools and frameworks specifically designed for creating interactive stories and text-based gameplay. Some popular options include Twine, Inform, and Quest [Source 3].

2. Focus on storytelling: In a graphical text adventure, the emphasis is on the narrative and player choices. Make sure to create a compelling story with interesting characters and branching paths. Pay attention to the dialogue and descriptions to engage the player and immerse them in the game world.

3. Use visual elements sparingly: While the game is primarily text-based, you can still incorporate visual elements to enhance the experience. Use images, icons, or simple graphical representations to provide visual cues or set the atmosphere. However, be mindful not to overload the game with excessive visuals, as the focus should remain on the text and player decision-making.

4. Implement intuitive user interface: Design a user interface that is easy to navigate and interact with. Use clear and concise instructions to guide the player through the game. Consider incorporating a menu system, clickable buttons, or hotkeys to provide smooth gameplay and enhance the user experience.

5. Incorporate puzzles and choices: To make the gameplay more engaging, include puzzles, riddles, and decision points that require the player to think and make choices. These interactive elements add depth and challenge to the game, giving players a sense of agency and immersion.

6. Test and iterate: Continuously playtest your game to identify any areas that may need improvement. Seek feedback from players and make necessary adjustments to enhance the gameplay and overall experience.

By following these suggestions, you can create a graphical text adventure game that is immersive and enjoyable for players. Remember to keep the gameplay simple and focus on the narrative and player choices to create a compelling experience.
