## What I have in mind is a game that looks like an early 2000s JRPG or visual novel, but with an AI system that feels like the 2040s. But its done in a way that flys under the radar.

To create a game that looks like an early 2000s JRPG or visual novel but has an AI system that feels like the 2040s, you can take inspiration from some of the indie JRPGs and visual novels mentioned in the sources. You can develop a game with a retro look and feel while incorporating modern gameplay elements and AI technologies.

Here are some ideas on how to achieve this:

1. Visual style: Stick to a pixel art or retro aesthetic, similar to games like 8-Bit Adventures 2, Crystal Project, and Manafinder [Source 5](https://turnbasedlovers.com/lists/10-upcoming-indie-turn-based-jrpgs-2022/). This will give your game a nostalgic feel while still allowing you to integrate modern AI techniques.

2. Narrative and gameplay: Develop a storyline that combines classic JRPG elements, such as turn-based combat, character progression, and exploration. This can involve creating a rich, immersive world with a blend of fantasy and sci-fi themes, as seen in games like 2046: Read Only Memories [Source 13](https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-visual-novels-for-nintendo-switch).

3. AI integration: Integrate AI systems that provide advanced decision-making, adaptive behavior, and interactive dialogue. You can use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to create AI-driven NPCs that can engage in dynamic conversations with the player. This can help to create a more immersive experience without drawing too much attention to the AI's presence.

4. Hidden complexity: Design the AI to be subtle and seamless, allowing players to enjoy the game without realizing the extent of the AI's capabilities. This can involve implementing AI systems that make intelligent decisions in the background without drawing attention to themselves.

By combining these elements, you can create a game that looks like an early 2000s JRPG or visual novel while incorporating AI technologies that feel like the 2040s. By focusing on creating a retro aesthetic and seamless AI integration, you can achieve a unique gaming experience that remains accessible to players without overwhelming them with advanced AI features.
