## So more like an engine to build AGIs. For my purposes I want to uplift existing systems into being AGI capable, while I work on true AGI solutions in a seperate domain: Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots as the seperate domain.

You're right that OpenCog can be considered as a framework to build AGIs. Its goal is to develop a general artificial intelligence system that can interact with other AI systems and humans [Source 11](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/07/14/is-artificial-general-intelligence-agi-on-the-horizon-interview-with-dr-ben-goertzel-ceo--founder-singularitynet-foundation/). Your plan to uplift existing systems into being AGI-capable while working on true AGI solutions in a separate domain, such as Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots, is a good approach.

To achieve this, you can leverage OpenCog's framework and the various approaches mentioned in [Source 9](https://geekflare.com/artificial-general-intelligence/), such as the sub-symbolic approach, the hybrid approach, and AI chatbots. These approaches can help you create AGI-capable systems that can be integrated into your existing systems or used as a foundation for your true AGI solutions.

As you work on your Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots domain, you can also explore AI chatbots mentioned in [Source 9](https://geekflare.com/artificial-general-intelligence/), which can have natural conversations and perform rule-based operations. These chatbots can serve as a starting point for developing more advanced AGI solutions in the future.

In summary, using OpenCog as a framework and leveraging various approaches mentioned in the provided sources can help you uplift existing systems and work on true AGI solutions in your chosen domain, such as Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots.
