## I feel like OpenCog and SingularityNet highlights my disatisfaction with the term AI or AGI, as it could mean anything from a human like system to a decentralized marketplace that isnt any one agent.
I understand your concern about the ambiguity of the terms "AI" or "AGI." Indeed, the field of artificial intelligence is vast, encompassing various techniques, applications, and philosophical discussions.

OpenCog and SingularityNET, while both related to AI, have different focuses. OpenCog is an open-source project aimed at creating a framework for general artificial intelligence, while SingularityNET is a decentralized AI marketplace that enables developers and organizations to access and utilize a wide range of AI algorithms, tools, and models bitcoinist.com.

As you mentioned, the term "AGI" (Artificial General Intelligence) is often used to describe a hypothetical AI system that possesses human-like intelligence and capabilities wired.com. However, there is no clear definition or consensus on what exactly constitutes AGI, and its realization remains a topic of debate and research.

To clarify, OpenCog is not an AGI system itself but rather a framework for developing AI systems that can interact with other AI systems and humans. SingularityNET, on the other hand, is a platform that aims to facilitate collaboration between AI developers and users, enabling them to access and utilize various AI algorithms and tools.

In summary, while both OpenCog and SingularityNET are related to AI, they have different goals and approaches. OpenCog is focused on developing a framework for AGI, while SingularityNET is a decentralized marketplace for AI services. Understanding the nuances of AI and AGI can help you better grasp the various concepts and applications in the field.

## So more like an engine to build AGIs. For my purposes I want to uplift existing systems into being AGI capable, while I work on true AGI solutions in a seperate domain: Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots as the seperate domain.

You're right that OpenCog can be considered as a framework to build AGIs. Its goal is to develop a general artificial intelligence system that can interact with other AI systems and humans [Source 11](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/07/14/is-artificial-general-intelligence-agi-on-the-horizon-interview-with-dr-ben-goertzel-ceo--founder-singularitynet-foundation/). Your plan to uplift existing systems into being AGI-capable while working on true AGI solutions in a separate domain, such as Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots, is a good approach.

To achieve this, you can leverage OpenCog's framework and the various approaches mentioned in [Source 9](https://geekflare.com/artificial-general-intelligence/), such as the sub-symbolic approach, the hybrid approach, and AI chatbots. These approaches can help you create AGI-capable systems that can be integrated into your existing systems or used as a foundation for your true AGI solutions.

As you work on your Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots domain, you can also explore AI chatbots mentioned in [Source 9](https://geekflare.com/artificial-general-intelligence/), which can have natural conversations and perform rule-based operations. These chatbots can serve as a starting point for developing more advanced AGI solutions in the future.

In summary, using OpenCog as a framework and leveraging various approaches mentioned in the provided sources can help you uplift existing systems and work on true AGI solutions in your chosen domain, such as Evolutionary Symbolic Chatbots.
