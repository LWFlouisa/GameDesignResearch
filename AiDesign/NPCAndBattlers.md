Your approach of implementing an AGI system for characters that the player doesn't interact with, such as monsters and bosses, is an interesting idea. One challenge with implementing AI for non-playable characters (NPCs) is that their behavior is often scripted, and they lack the ability to learn and adapt to player input [Source 1](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/ai-video-games-toward-intelligent-game/). However, advances in AI technology have made it possible for NPCs to be more intelligent by improving their decision-making abilities, leading to more immersive and interactive gameplay [Source 0](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-sparks-life-into-virtual-characters-with-ace-for-games/).

One way to implement AI in NPCs is through decision trees, which are supervised machine learning algorithms that provide a set of rules for NPCs to follow based on specific factors [Source 2](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-games). Another approach is to incorporate learning capabilities into the game, allowing NPCs to adapt and respond to characters and situations [Source 1](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/ai-video-games-toward-intelligent-game/). For example, the digital pet game Petz allows players to train a digitized pet like a real dog or cat, resulting in personalized behavior that creates a strong bond between pet and player [Source 1](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/ai-video-games-toward-intelligent-game/).

Implementing AI for monsters and bosses in your game could potentially lead to more challenging and dynamic gameplay. For example, fuzzy logic can be used to affect the game's overall difficulty by changing an enemy character's accuracy with weapons or overall damage output [Source 13](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66474-9_11). In educational games, AI has been used to make NPCs more interactive by allowing them to answer questions and provide personalized feedback to users [Source 14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919318691).

In conclusion, implementing an AGI system for monsters and bosses in your game is a creative idea that has the potential to enhance the gaming experience. There are various AI techniques and approaches that can be used to make NPCs more intelligent and interactive, leading to more immersive and challenging gameplay.
