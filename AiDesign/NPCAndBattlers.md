Your approach of implementing an AGI system for characters that the player doesn't interact with, such as monsters and bosses, is an interesting idea. One challenge with implementing AI for non-playable characters (NPCs) is that their behavior is often scripted, and they lack the ability to learn and adapt to player input [Source 1](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/ai-video-games-toward-intelligent-game/). However, advances in AI technology have made it possible for NPCs to be more intelligent by improving their decision-making abilities, leading to more immersive and interactive gameplay [Source 0](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-sparks-life-into-virtual-characters-with-ace-for-games/).

One way to implement AI in NPCs is through decision trees, which are supervised machine learning algorithms that provide a set of rules for NPCs to follow based on specific factors [Source 2](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-games). Another approach is to incorporate learning capabilities into the game, allowing NPCs to adapt and respond to characters and situations [Source 1](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/ai-video-games-toward-intelligent-game/). For example, the digital pet game Petz allows players to train a digitized pet like a real dog or cat, resulting in personalized behavior that creates a strong bond between pet and player [Source 1](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/ai-video-games-toward-intelligent-game/).

Implementing AI for monsters and bosses in your game could potentially lead to more challenging and dynamic gameplay. For example, fuzzy logic can be used to affect the game's overall difficulty by changing an enemy character's accuracy with weapons or overall damage output [Source 13](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66474-9_11). In educational games, AI has been used to make NPCs more interactive by allowing them to answer questions and provide personalized feedback to users [Source 14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919318691).

In conclusion, implementing an AGI system for monsters and bosses in your game is a creative idea that has the potential to enhance the gaming experience. There are various AI techniques and approaches that can be used to make NPCs more intelligent and interactive, leading to more immersive and challenging gameplay.

You raise a valid concern about the potential difficulty of designing boss fights with an AGI system, as the AI could make the bosses too challenging for players. However, this issue can be mitigated by carefully designing the AI and the boss encounters to ensure they are balanced and enjoyable for players.

One approach to balance AGI-driven bosses is to incorporate dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) mechanisms. DDA allows the game to automatically adjust the difficulty of the boss encounters based on the player's performance, ensuring that the experience remains challenging but not overwhelming [Source 3](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/real-world-challenges-for-agi). This can be achieved by monitoring player progress and adjusting the AI's behavior, health, or abilities accordingly.

Another approach is to design the boss encounters with multiple phases or stages, similar to the multi-phase boss fights in some RPGs [Source 7](https://roleplayersrespite.com/multi-phase-dnd-boss-fight-mechanics). By incorporating different phases, each with unique challenges and tactics, players can learn and adapt to the boss's evolving strategies. This can help create a more engaging and balanced boss fight experience.

Additionally, it's essential to ensure that the AGI-driven boss encounters make sense within the context of the game world and the player's progression [Source 7](https://roleplayersrespite.com/multi-phase-dnd-boss-fight-mechanics). By seeding hints and clues throughout the game, the boss encounters can become more immersive and believable, even if they are driven by advanced AI systems.

In conclusion, while implementing an AGI system for boss encounters could potentially make them impossible for some players, this challenge can be addressed through careful design, dynamic difficulty adjustment, multi-phase encounters, and immersive context. By carefully considering these factors, you can create engaging and balanced boss fights that leverage the power of AGI while maintaining a enjoyable gaming experience.
