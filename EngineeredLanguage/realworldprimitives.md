After watching the video and reviewing the search results, it seems that the question is related to the concept of creating an engineered language that can be used for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Specifically, the question is asking whether words in such a language would need to have real-world referents, even in a simulated environment.

The idea of an engineered language for AGI is an interesting one, and there are several different approaches that have been proposed. One approach is to create a language that is based on logical primitives, which can be used to construct more complex statements and concepts [Source 1]. Another approach is to create a language that is grounded in perception and action, using sensory experiences as the basis for meaning [Source 2].

In the context of a simulated environment, the question of whether words in an engineered language need to have real-world referents is a complex one. On the one hand, it might seem that in a simulated environment, there is no need for words to refer to real-world objects. After all, the objects in the simulation are themselves representations of real-world objects, and so it might be possible to create a language that refers directly to these representations.

However, there are several reasons why it might still be useful to ground the language in real-world referents, even in a simulation. Some possible reasons include:

- **Ease of learning:** If the language is grounded in real-world referents, it may be easier for humans (or other agents) to learn, since they can connect the words to their existing knowledge of the world [Source 3].
- **Flexibility:** Real-world referents can provide a flexible basis for meaning, since they can be reinterpreted in different contexts [Source 2].
- **Robustness:** If the simulated environment is imperfect or incomplete, grounding the language in real-world referents may provide a way to handle situations that were not explicitly programmed into the simulation [Source 1].

Of course, there are also some potential drawbacks to grounding the language in real-world referents, even in a simulated environment. For example:

- **Limited scope:** If the language is too tightly bound to real-world referents, it may be difficult to use in contexts that are not directly related to those referents [Source 2].
- **Ambiguity:** Real-world referents may be ambiguous or subject to interpretation, which could lead to confusion or errors in communication [Source 1].

Overall, it seems that whether or not an engineered language for AGI needs to be grounded in real-world referents depends on a variety of factors, including the goals of the language, the nature of the simulated environment, and the intended users of the language. While some approaches may benefit from grounding the language in real-world referents, others may not require this level of grounding and may instead rely on other mechanisms for meaning and communication.

## So it might have with emergent capabilities for a simulation environment. How about for game engines?

While game engines and simulated environments have some similarities, there are also some differences that may affect the way in which an engineered language is designed. In game development, the choice of programming language and game engine can have a significant impact on the final product [1].

Game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and CryEngine provide a range of tools and functionalities for game developers, including 2D and 3D graphics rendering, physics, sound, and AI [5]. These engines often have their own programming languages or support multiple languages, such as C++ and JavaScript [1].

When it comes to designing an engineered language for game development, it may be useful to consider the specific features and requirements of the chosen game engine and programming language. For example, if the game engine supports physics simulation, it may be possible to create a language that allows game objects to interact with each other in a natural and intuitive way [14].

However, it is important to note that the goals and requirements of a game engine may be different from those of a simulated environment. In a game, the focus is often on creating an immersive and engaging experience for the player, whereas a simulated environment may be designed for research or training purposes [5].

Therefore, the choice of whether or not to ground an engineered language in real-world referents may depend on the specific goals and requirements of the game or simulated environment. For example, if the game is set in a realistic environment, it may be useful to ground the language in real-world referents to enhance the player's immersion and understanding of the game world. On the other hand, if the game is more abstract or stylized, it may not be necessary to use real-world referents [1].

Overall, the choice of whether or not to ground an engineered language in real-world referents for game development will likely depend on a variety of factors, including the specific game engine and programming language being used, the goals of the game, and the preferences of the game developers.
