## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt_WX4wmkPg So to make an engineered language work for AGI would that mean words in said language would need to have real world objects to refer to, even when designing a simulation environment?

After watching the video and reviewing the search results, it seems that the question is related to the concept of creating an engineered language that can be used for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Specifically, the question is asking whether words in such a language would need to have real-world referents, even in a simulated environment.

The idea of an engineered language for AGI is an interesting one, and there are several different approaches that have been proposed. One approach is to create a language that is based on logical primitives, which can be used to construct more complex statements and concepts [Source 1]. Another approach is to create a language that is grounded in perception and action, using sensory experiences as the basis for meaning [Source 2].

In the context of a simulated environment, the question of whether words in an engineered language need to have real-world referents is a complex one. On the one hand, it might seem that in a simulated environment, there is no need for words to refer to real-world objects. After all, the objects in the simulation are themselves representations of real-world objects, and so it might be possible to create a language that refers directly to these representations.

However, there are several reasons why it might still be useful to ground the language in real-world referents, even in a simulation. Some possible reasons include:

- **Ease of learning:** If the language is grounded in real-world referents, it may be easier for humans (or other agents) to learn, since they can connect the words to their existing knowledge of the world [Source 3].
- **Flexibility:** Real-world referents can provide a flexible basis for meaning, since they can be reinterpreted in different contexts [Source 2].
- **Robustness:** If the simulated environment is imperfect or incomplete, grounding the language in real-world referents may provide a way to handle situations that were not explicitly programmed into the simulation [Source 1].

Of course, there are also some potential drawbacks to grounding the language in real-world referents, even in a simulated environment. For example:

- **Limited scope:** If the language is too tightly bound to real-world referents, it may be difficult to use in contexts that are not directly related to those referents [Source 2].
- **Ambiguity:** Real-world referents may be ambiguous or subject to interpretation, which could lead to confusion or errors in communication [Source 1].

Overall, it seems that whether or not an engineered language for AGI needs to be grounded in real-world referents depends on a variety of factors, including the goals of the language, the nature of the simulated environment, and the intended users of the language. While some approaches may benefit from grounding the language in real-world referents, others may not require this level of grounding and may instead rely on other mechanisms for meaning and communication.

## So it might have with emergent capabilities for a simulation environment. How about for game engines?

While game engines and simulated environments have some similarities, there are also some differences that may affect the way in which an engineered language is designed. In game development, the choice of programming language and game engine can have a significant impact on the final product [1].

Game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and CryEngine provide a range of tools and functionalities for game developers, including 2D and 3D graphics rendering, physics, sound, and AI [5]. These engines often have their own programming languages or support multiple languages, such as C++ and JavaScript [1].

When it comes to designing an engineered language for game development, it may be useful to consider the specific features and requirements of the chosen game engine and programming language. For example, if the game engine supports physics simulation, it may be possible to create a language that allows game objects to interact with each other in a natural and intuitive way [14].

However, it is important to note that the goals and requirements of a game engine may be different from those of a simulated environment. In a game, the focus is often on creating an immersive and engaging experience for the player, whereas a simulated environment may be designed for research or training purposes [5].

Therefore, the choice of whether or not to ground an engineered language in real-world referents may depend on the specific goals and requirements of the game or simulated environment. For example, if the game is set in a realistic environment, it may be useful to ground the language in real-world referents to enhance the player's immersion and understanding of the game world. On the other hand, if the game is more abstract or stylized, it may not be necessary to use real-world referents [1].

Overall, the choice of whether or not to ground an engineered language in real-world referents for game development will likely depend on a variety of factors, including the specific game engine and programming language being used, the goals of the game, and the preferences of the game developers.

## What are good example of a simulation environment as suppose to a game engine? Are flight simulators using simulation in a different sense?

Yes, there are some differences between simulation environments and game engines. While game engines are designed primarily for creating video games, simulation environments are often used for research, training, or testing purposes [Source 5]. 

Simulation environments can take many forms, depending on their intended use. For example, a flight simulator is a type of simulation environment that is used to train pilots in a safe and controlled setting [Source 9]. Other examples of simulation environments include driving simulators, medical simulators, and engineering simulators [Source 14]. 

In general, simulation environments are designed to replicate real-world systems or phenomena, and may include a range of physical and computational models to achieve this goal [Source 3]. In contrast, game engines are designed to create immersive and interactive digital worlds, and may include features like graphics rendering, physics simulation, and AI [Source 5]. 

However, there is some overlap between simulation environments and game engines, particularly in the realm of simulation games. Simulation games are a type of video game that simulate real-world activities or scenarios, and often use game engines to create their digital environments [Source 8]. Examples of simulation games include flight simulators, driving simulators, and management simulators [Source 8]. 

In terms of whether an engineered language for simulation environments needs to be grounded in real-world referents, the same considerations apply as for game engines. Depending on the specific goals and requirements of the simulation environment, it may be useful to ground the language in real-world referents to enhance its ease of use, flexibility, and robustness [Source 1].

## What would you need for an environment design to simulate a world that branched off from our history but is otherwise the same?

To simulate a world that branched off from our history but is otherwise the same, you would need to consider various factors, such as physical, social, and environmental changes. The following are some key points to consider:

1. Physical changes: If you want to simulate a world that branched off from our history, you need to consider the physical changes that would have occurred. This could include changes in geography, climate, flora, and fauna. For instance, if you want to simulate a world where the ice age never ended, you would need to consider how this would affect the climate, the environment, and the animals that live in that world. [Source 0]

2. Social changes: You would also need to consider the social changes that would have occurred in the alternate world. This could include changes in population, culture, politics, and technology. For example, if you want to simulate a world where the Roman Empire never fell, you would need to consider how this would affect the culture, politics, and technology of that world. [Source 3]

3. Environmental design: Environmental design is a crucial aspect of simulating a world that branched off from our history. Environmental design involves designing indoor and outdoor spaces that are in ecological and aesthetic harmony with their surroundings. As an environmental designer, you would need to consider the larger aesthetic picture when planning and creating your spaces, structures, and other projects. You would also need to learn how to construct structures and spaces that are both ecologically sustainable and environmentally safe. [Source 4]

4. Building simulation: Building simulation is a way to test how elements of building design will perform under real-world conditions. This is done using a mathematical model that re-creates conditions in a virtual environment. These computer-based simulations enable architects and engineers to evaluate the performance of their designs. Users provide information like climate data, lighting requirements, and occupancy profiles. Based on these inputs, simulation results can determine inside temperature, fresh air rates, CO2 levels, and energy consumption. Building simulations help balance energy efficiency with occupant comfort while reducing cost and time in the design process. [Source 9]

5. Simulation tools: To simulate a world that branched off from our history, you need simulation tools that can help you create a virtual environment. These tools can number in the hundreds and vary based on the industry application. Modeling and simulation are applied to a range of disciplines in the built environment, from sizing HVAC equipment to calculating performance ratings for green building certifications. Simulation workflows begin with a CAD model, which generates a digital representation of the building. From there, software tools can be selected based on the intended purpose or result needed. [Source 9]

6. Capturing more physics: One of the trends in building simulation is capturing more physics. The indoor environment is heavily influenced by what is happening outside, and this is especially true when buildings utilize natural or mixed-mode ventilation. The ability to capture more physics via CFD to be used in building simulation is becoming technologically feasible and will allow architects and engineers to simulate various scenarios. For example, atmospheric changes significantly impact heating and cooling loads whether that is through ventilation or infiltration. Building simulation software in 2021 can couple these variables more effectively and provide a complete picture of the external environmental impact on complex heating and cooling system design. [Source 9]

In conclusion, simulating a world that branched off from our history but is otherwise the same requires considering various factors, such as physical, social, and environmental changes. Environmental design and building simulation are crucial aspects of simulating such a world, and there are several simulation tools available to help you create a virtual environment.

## So a simulation designed to mimic human cognition would be like a game but not a game, but overlap through simulation games?

While there is some overlap between simulation games and simulations designed to mimic human cognition, they are not entirely the same. Simulation games typically aim to replicate real-world scenarios or experiences, while simulations designed to mimic human cognition aim to replicate the way the human brain works. [Source 8] 

Simulating human cognition involves creating models that can replicate the way the brain processes information, stores memories, and learns. These models can be used to study various aspects of human cognition, such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making. For instance, a cognitive simulation can be used to study how people perceive and remember faces, how they make decisions based on incomplete information, or how they learn new skills. [Source 13]

One of the challenges of simulating human cognition is that it is a complex and multifaceted process that involves many different brain regions and cognitive functions. To create a realistic cognitive simulation, researchers need to take into account a wide range of factors, such as neural connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and the effects of neurotransmitters. They also need to ensure that their models are consistent with the available empirical evidence from neuroscience and psychology. [Source 11]

Creating a cognitive simulation typically involves using machine learning algorithms to train a model on a large dataset of real-world examples. The model is then tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance. This process is repeated until the model achieves a satisfactory level of accuracy. Once the model is trained, it can be used to perform various tasks, such as recognizing objects in images, generating natural language, or playing games. [Source 9]

In summary, while there is some overlap between simulation games and simulations designed to mimic human cognition, they are not entirely the same. Simulating human cognition involves creating models that can replicate the way the human brain works, and it is a complex and multifaceted process that requires taking into account a wide range of factors. Creating a cognitive simulation typically involves using machine learning algorithms to train a model on a large dataset of real-world examples.
